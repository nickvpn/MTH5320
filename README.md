Course Description: A project-based introduction to deep learning architectures, algorithms, and applications. Includes multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformers; theory and implementation of learning algorithms, training and tuning procedures; applications to computer vision and natural language processing.

Practical Description: We will focus on classification, regression, and unsupervised learning problems with artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs are algorithms we train to map input datapoints (could be text, images, audio/video files, database entries) to desired targets (numbers, categories, patterns, etc.). Through this training, the computer learns to classify (or estimate) targets for unknown data points.

Examples: Can a computer classify a picture of an animal as a cat? Can it differentiate between hip-hop and jazz music? Can it interpret the sentiment behind text? Can it generate synthetic data?
